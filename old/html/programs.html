	<div id="title">
        <img src="photos/programs/iconwtext.png" alt="">You can find things i've coded/programmed here! Again, don't expect any well-made and useful programs lol
    </div>
	<h4 id="autismgen"><b>The Autism Generator</h4></b>
	<p>You can download it by clicking <b><a href="https://quicksoapy.nl/Stuff/TheAutismGenerator.exe">here</a></b>.</p>
	<p>It's a program that fetches 4 pictures of people from thispersondoesnotexist.com, and if you click one there's a 1 in 4 chance he or she has autism, and you'll lose. If not, you'll earn a point in the textbox and you can try again.</p>
	<p>Why does it exist? I don't know, i wanted to learn C# and i don't like being serious. It was very educational making this program, so that's good! :D</p>
	<p>Why does it take so long (actually 3006ms longer than usual) to load the pictures? Because i set a delay of 1002ms between all photos, because the website i fetch them from produces a new image every 1000ms and otherwise duplicates would appear. Who would like that now.</p>
	<p>If you want to see the code, <b><a href="https://github.com/Quicksoapy/VB-School/tree/main/test1WF">here</a></b>'s the github repository. Do what you like with it, i don't really care as long as i don't lose any of my files.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4 id="Launcher"><b>File/Program Launcher</h4></b>
	<p>You can download it by clicking <b><a href="https://quicksoapy.nl/Stuff/Launcher.zip">here</a></b>.</p>
	<p>It's a launcher with a dark- and lightmode, you can add up to 7 programs yourself, and you can save both of those things (The save will only work if you keep the exe in the folder right now, might change later idk).</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/Quicksoapy/VB-School/tree/main/launcherWPF/WpfApp1">Here's</a> the github repository if you want to see how i made it. I wanted to learn to work with classes and methods i can re-use later, so i did.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4 id="Bot"><b>SoapyBot</h4></b>
	<p>You can add it to your server by clicking <b><a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=821107466476847114&permissions=8&scope=bot">here</a></b>.</p>
	<p>It is a discord bot that does stuff. The default prefix is * , and you can see all the commands using *help. Have fun with it lol</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/Quicksoapy/QuickyBot2">Here's</a> the github repository if you want to see how i made it.</p>

	<hr>
	<h4 id="Pybot"><b>Snek Bot</h4></b>
	<p>It's a bot i made in python, because i got access to google cloud which doesn't support c# as far as i know. And if it does, i don't really care, i wanted to learn python anyways.</p>
	<p>Add the bot to your server by clicking <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=795994490719698944&permissions=8&scope=bot">here</a>.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4 id="osumusic"><b>osu!music</h4></b>
	<p>It's an osu music exporter, you know that thing like 20 people already made before me :). Mine is fairly simple, but because of that it skips almost no songs, which kind of annoyed me when using other exporters. When i tested it, it skipped out of my 22754 mapsets. It's a console app, cuz making nice UI is boring. To download it, click <a href="https://quicksoapy.nl/Stuff/osu!music.zip">here</a>, and look <a href="https://github.com/Quicksoapy/osu-music/tree/master/osumusic">here for the github repository.</a></p>
    <hr>
    <h4 id="osumusic"><b>SoapyCryptor</h4></b>
    <p>It's a simple encryptor i made for fun, changes every character to a random character and saves which is which. Click <a href="https://github.com/Quicksoapy/SoapyCryptor/tree/main">here</a> for the github repository.</p>
